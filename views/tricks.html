      <h2>Tricks for Solo Living</h2>
      <ul class="trick-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Sticky Note on the Door:</strong> Place a sticky note on your
          front door listing essential items to check before leaving, such as
          keys, phone, and wallet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emergency Supplies Near Your Bed:</strong> Keep emergency
          medications and a water bottle within easy reach near your bed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Phone Widgets:</strong> Add widgets to your phone's home
          screen for quick access to the weather forecast and a clock showing
          the time difference with your home country.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To-Do Lists:</strong> Use a to-do list or reminder app, or
          keep a sticky note on your desk to track daily tasks and important
          deadlines like assignments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Phone Stand:</strong> A phone stand may seem unnecessary at
          first, but it’s incredibly helpful for hands-free use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rain Jacket:</strong> While an umbrella is essential, a rain
          jacket is more practical and can be more useful in certain situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clothes Rack:</strong> Instead of scattering clothes on chairs
          or the floor, use a clothes rack to organize your clothes, hats, and
          bags. Choose a size that fits your room.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Foldable Basket:</strong> A foldable basket is space-saving
          and useful for washing socks and underwear or even for soaking your
          feet in warm water after a long day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Humidifier:</strong> If you often wake up with a dry throat,
          consider getting a small humidifier to place near your bed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Food Containers:</strong> You don’t need to buy new
          containers—reuse ones from food deliveries. Alternatively, buy a few
          (3-4 are enough) for storing leftovers or meal prepping.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organizers:</strong> Use organizers to sort socks, underwear,
          nail clippers, and other small personal items.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reusable Shopping Bags:</strong> Always carry reusable
          shopping bags when you go out. They’re practical, cost-effective, and
          eco-friendly.
        </li>
